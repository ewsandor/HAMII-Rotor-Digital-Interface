# HAMII Rotor Digital Interface
An interface to control a CDE HAM II antenna rotor with a computer based on the Rotor-EZ protocol.

This project uses an Arduino Nano to control relays to position a CDE HAM II rotor.  The software for the rotor is included in the 'software' folder.

A schematic and PCB is included in the folder 'pcb'.  
The PCB depends on Eagle librarys provided by the following repositories:
Arduino-Eagle-Cad-Library   -   https://github.com/cyberlink1/Arduino-Eagle-Cad-Library
Make-Tools-Eagle-Libraries  -   https://github.com/dvdnhm/Maker-Tools-Eagle-Libraries
