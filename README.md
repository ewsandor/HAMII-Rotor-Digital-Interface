# HAMII Rotor Digital Interface 
An interface to control a CDE HAM II antenna rotor with a computer based on the Rotor-EZ protocol.

<p>
This project uses an Arduino Nano to control relays to position a CDE HAM II rotor.  The software for the rotor is included in the 'software' folder.
</p>

<p>
A schematic and PCB is included in the folder 'pcb'.  
The PCB depends on Eagle librarys provided by the following repositories:<br>
Arduino-Eagle-Cad-Library   -   https://github.com/cyberlink1/Arduino-Eagle-Cad-Library<br>
Maker-Tools-Eagle-Libraries  -   https://github.com/dvdnhm/Maker-Tools-Eagle-Libraries<br>
  -Error exists in Maker-Tools-Eagle-Libraries, NO and NC are reversed on relay schematic symbol. HAMII Rotor Digital Interface has corrected for this error
